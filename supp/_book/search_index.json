Alan Covey, Robert Z. Selden Jr., Nicole Payntar, and Astrid Runggaldier 2022-01-27 Preface Reproducibilitythe ability to recompute resultsand replicabilitythe chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent resultare two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research (Leek and Peng 2015). 0.1 Basis of inquiry After centuries of looting along Perus North Coast, archaeologists acknowledge that the pottery of the Chimú Empire is one of the most collected Andean artifacts, but also one of the most poorly understood. Much of the enduring classificatory uncertainty comes from the problematic provenance of most Chimú vessels, and the fact that the distinctive blackware identified as Chimú represents the production of workshops from across an extensive area, during periods of regional political decentralization (c. 900-1200 CE), imperial growth (c. 1200-1450), and foreign conquest by the Inca (c. 1450-1535) and Spanish (after 1532) empires. This chapter builds on previous seriations and field observations, using geometric morphometric analysis of a sample of 3D-scanned Chimú bottles from publicly held collections at the University of Texas (Austin) and the American Museum of Natural History. Since Chimú bottles were formed in workshops using molds, variations in vessel shape can serve as indicators of variable practices. We compare a sample of typical Chimú blackware bottles with a sample of Inca-Chimú vessels that carry features typical of the short Inca occupation of the North Coast. Differences between the two samples offer new lines of evidence that can guide more precise classifications of these vessels, as well as new interpretations of the imperial history of Perus North Coast. 0.2 Primary findings 0.2.1 Linear metrics Bottles and jars differ significantly in orifice diameter Bottles and jars differ significantly in belly diameter Figure 0.1: Boxplots for vessel form by a, orifice diameter; b, base diameter; c, neck diameter; d, belly diameter; e, height; and f, rim thickness. 0.2.2 Geometric morphometrics Bottles and jars differ significantly in shape Bottles and jars do not differ in size Figure 0.2: Mean shapes for bottles (a), jars (c), and comparison of bottle (gray) and jar (black) shape (b). 0.3 Acknowledgments We extend our gratitude to 0.4 Funding Components of this analytical work flow were developed and funded by a Preservation Technology and Training grant (P14AP00138) to RZS from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training (NCPTT), and additional grants to RZS from the Caddo Tribe of Oklahoma and the National Forests and Grasslands in Texas (15-PA-11081300-033 and 20-PA-11081300-074). Funding to scan the Chimú vessels in the Art and Art History Collections at The University of Texas at Austin was provided by The University of Texas at Austin. 0.5 Data management This volume is written in Markdown, and all files needed to reproduce it are included in the GitHub repository, which is digitally curated on the Open Science Framework. The reproducible nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Reproducibility projects in psychology and cancer biology are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology (Marwick 2016; Ivanovait et al. 2020; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020), and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results (Marwick et al. 2019). Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results haveexplicitly or implicitlya major impact on scientific progress (Peels and Bouter 2018). The data and analysis code associated with this project can be accessed through this document or the GitHub repository, and is digitally curated on the Open Science Framework (DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/VZHJR). 0.6 Colophon This version of the analysis was generated on 2022-01-27 03:05:49 using the following computational environment and dependencies: # what R packages and versions were used? if (&quot;devtools&quot; %in% installed.packages()) devtools::session_info() ## - Session info --------------------------------------------------------------- ## setting value ## version R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01) ## os Windows 10 x64 (build 19044) ## system x86_64, mingw32 ## ui RTerm ## language (EN) ## collate English_United States.1252 ## ctype English_United States.1252 ## tz America/Chicago ## date 2022-01-27 ## pandoc 2.14.0.3 @ C:/Program Files/RStudio/bin/pandoc/ (via rmarkdown) ## ## - Packages ------------------------------------------------------------------- ## package * version date (UTC) lib source ## bookdown 0.24 2021-09-02 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.1) ## brio 1.1.3 2021-11-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## bslib 0.3.1 2021-10-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.1) ## cachem 1.0.6 2021-08-19 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.1) ## callr 3.7.0 2021-04-20 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## cli 3.1.0 2021-10-27 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.1) ## crayon 1.4.2 2021-10-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.1) ## desc 1.4.0 2021-09-28 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.1) ## devtools 2.4.3 2021-11-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## digest 0.6.29 2021-12-01 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## ellipsis 0.3.2 2021-04-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## evaluate 0.14 2019-05-28 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## fastmap 1.1.0 2021-01-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## fs 1.5.2 2021-12-08 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## glue 1.6.1 2022-01-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## highr 0.9 2021-04-16 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## htmltools 0.5.2 2021-08-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.1) ## jquerylib 0.1.4 2021-04-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## jsonlite 1.7.3 2022-01-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## knitr 1.37 2021-12-16 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## lifecycle 1.0.1 2021-09-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.1) ## magrittr 2.0.1 2020-11-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## memoise 2.0.1 2021-11-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## pkgbuild 1.3.1 2021-12-20 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## pkgload 1.2.4 2021-11-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## prettyunits 1.1.1 2020-01-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## processx 3.5.2 2021-04-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## ps 1.6.0 2021-02-28 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## purrr 0.3.4 2020-04-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## R6 2.5.1 2021-08-19 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.1) ## remotes 2.4.2 2021-11-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## rlang 0.4.12 2021-10-18 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.1) ## rmarkdown 2.11 2021-09-14 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.1) ## rprojroot 2.0.2 2020-11-15 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## rstudioapi 0.13 2020-11-12 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## sass 0.4.0 2021-05-12 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## sessioninfo 1.2.2 2021-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## stringi 1.7.6 2021-11-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## stringr 1.4.0 2019-02-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.0) ## testthat 3.1.2 2022-01-20 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## usethis 2.1.5 2021-12-09 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## withr 2.4.3 2021-11-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## xfun 0.29 2021-12-14 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## yaml 2.2.2 2022-01-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.1.2) ## ## [1] C:/Users/seldenjrz/Documents/R/win-library/4.1 ## [2] C:/Program Files/R/R-4.1.2/library ## ## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Git commit details are: # where can I find this commit? if (&quot;git2r&quot; %in% installed.packages() &amp; git2r::in_repository(path = &quot;.&quot;)) git2r::repository(here::here()) ## Local: main D:/github/peru.bottle.jar ## Remote: main @ origin (https://github.com/seldenlab/peru.bottle.jar) ## Head: [a615260] 2022-01-27: &lt;init analysis&gt; References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
